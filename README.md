# Bias Evaluation Benchmark Dataset based on TIMIT

This repository contains two benchmark dataset variations for bias evaluation of the Vocie Privacy Challenge. 

The benchmark datasets are based on TIMIT and were created using the algorithm proposed in [1].

Ten male and ten female speakers from each dialect were selected to ensure subgroup balance resulting in a total of 160 speakers.
One dataset consists of ten utterance pairs per speaker, i.e. five same and five different speaker pairs, resulting in 800 same speaker and 800 different speaker trials.
